# Harsh Ledwani — Portfolio (Next.js + Tailwind)

This is a starter portfolio scaffold generated with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Features:
- Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Testimonials, Contact
- Sticky, accessible navigation with smooth scroll and active link highlighting
- Subtle animations and scroll reveal effects (Framer Motion + IntersectionObserver)
- Dark/Light mode, responsive layouts, and accessibility-first focus styles
- Placeholder images and copy ready to be replaced with your real content

Local development:
1. cd next-portfolio
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Deploy: recommended to Vercel or Netlify for static optimization.

Replace placeholder images and copy with your real content. Provide social links and preferred email/contact info if you'd like them included in the header/footer. A public resume PDF is available at `/resume` by default — replace `public/resume.pdf` with your final resume. Also tell me if you'd like TypeScript or additional pages (blog, resume PDF improvements, case studies) and I will add them.
